\description{
A sample \code{DGELRT} object, generated with \code{edgeR}
}
\details{
This \code{DGELRT} object contains the results of a Differential
Expression Analysis performed on data from the \code{macrophage} package, more
precisely contrasting the counts from macrophage associated with different
stimulation conditions, including IFNg treatment, Salmonella infection, and
their combined effects.

The code to create said object can be found in the folder \verb{/inst/scripts} in
the DeeDeeExperiment package, the file is called \code{generate_data.R}.
