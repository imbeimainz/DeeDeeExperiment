A sample \code{DGEExact} object, generated with \code{edgeR}
}
\description{
A sample \code{DGEExact} object, generated with \code{edgeR}
}
\details{
This \code{DGEExact} object contains the results of a Differential
Expression Analysis performed on data from the \code{macrophage} package, more
precisely contrasting the counts from macrophage associated with IFNg to
those associated with IFNg and Salmonella.

The code to create said object can be found in the folder \verb{/inst/scripts} in
the DeeDeeExperiment package, the file is called \code{generate_data.R}.
