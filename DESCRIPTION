Description: DeeDeeExperiment is an S4 class extending the SummarizedExperiemnt
  class, designed to integrate and manage transciptomic analysis results. It introduces
  two dedicated slots to store Differential Expression (DE) analysis results and
  Functional Enrichment analysis outcomes, providing a structured approach for
  downstream analysis.
